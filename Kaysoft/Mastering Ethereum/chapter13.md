#### Ethereum Virtual Machine

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. These smart contracts are written in a high-level programming language and compiled into low-level bytecode that is executable on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The EVM is a stack-based virtual machine that executes the bytecode of a smart contract. It is implemented in the Ethereum client software and is responsible for executing the code of a smart contract when it is called. The EVM is designed to be simple and deterministic, so that it can run the same code in different environments and produce the same results.

Opcode, short for operation code, is the term used to describe the individual instructions that the EVM executes. These opcodes are the building blocks of the bytecode that is executed by the EVM. The EVM has a set of over 200 opcodes that are used to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as arithmetic operations, logical operations, control flow, and interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

For example, the ADD opcode performs an addition operation, while the CALL opcode is used to call another contract or function. The SSTORE opcode is used to store data in storage, and the SLOAD opcode is used to load data from storage.

The use of opcodes in the EVM allows smart contracts to be executed in a predictable and transparent manner, ensuring that the code runs as intended and that the results of the computation can be verified by anyone.
