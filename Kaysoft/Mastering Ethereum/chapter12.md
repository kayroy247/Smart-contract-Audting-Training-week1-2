#### Decentralized Applications

A decentralized application (DApp) is a software application that runs on a decentralized network, such as the Ethereum blockchain. DApps have several key components, including:

Smart contracts: These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts enable the automation of contract execution and enforcement, reducing the need for intermediaries and enabling more secure and efficient transactions.

Front-end user interface: This is the part of the DApp that users interact with. It can be a web application, mobile application, or other user interface that allows users to access and interact with the DApp.

Decentralized network: This is the underlying network that the DApp runs on, such as the Ethereum blockchain. The decentralized network provides the infrastructure for the DApp to operate and enables it to be decentralized and distributed.

Oracles: These are third-party services that provide external data to the DApp. Oracles allow the DApp to interact with the real world by retrieving data from external sources and providing it to the smart contracts.

Cryptocurrency: Many DApps use a cryptocurrency, such as Ether (ETH), as a means of exchange or as a way to incentivize participation in the network.

Overall, these components work together to enable DApps to operate in a decentralized and distributed manner, enabling more transparent, secure, and efficient transactions and interactions on the blockchain.
