#### Smart contracts and Vyper

Vyper is a programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed to be simpler, safer, and more readable than Solidity, the most commonly used language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.

To write a smart contract with Vyper, you will need to install the Vyper compiler on your computer and create a new Vyper file with the .vy extension. You can then write your contract in Vyper using a syntax that is similar to Python.
